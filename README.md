# Core-Public-Event-Vocabulary

This is the repository for the development and maintenance of the Core Public Event Vocabulary. 

The Core Public Event Vocabulary provides a minimum set of classes and properties for describing a public event, e.g. a summit, conference, etc. 

This specification is under development by the Working Group of the Core Public Event Vocabulary following an open and collaborative process (https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/document/process-and-methodology-developing-core-vocabularies). This vocabulary will be published under the ISA Open Metadata Licence v1.1, https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/licence/isa-open-metadata-licence-v11.
